# Aran's Game Tools for Blender

**Aran's Game Tools** is a Blender add-on designed to streamline common game asset preparation tasks, especially for Unreal Engine workflows. It provides tools for mesh renaming, vertex color ID map generation, lightmap UV creation, and moreâ€”all accessible from the Blender UI.

---

## Features

- **Loose Parts to Vertex Colors:**  
  Assigns unique vertex colors to each disconnected mesh island (loose part) for easy ID map creation.

- **Bake Vertex Colors to Texture:**  
  Bake your vertex color ID map to a texture for export to game engines.

- **Create Vertex Groups from Loose Parts:**  
  Optionally create a vertex group for each loose part.

- **Lightmap UV Generation:**  
  Automatically create and unwrap a second UV channel for lightmapping, compatible with Unreal Engine.

- **Custom Prefix/Suffix Tools:**  
  Easily set naming conventions for static meshes, VFX meshes, and LODs.

- **Export Path Management:**  
  Set and manage export directories for Unreal Engine assets.

## Installation

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. In Blender, go to **Edit > Preferences > Add-ons > Install**.
3. Select the `.zip` or the folder containing this add-on.
4. Enable **Aran's Game Tools** in the add-ons list.

---

## Usage

All tools are available in the **3D Viewport > Sidebar (N) > Game Tools** tab.

### Vertex Color ID Map

1. Select your mesh.
2. In the **Game Tools** panel, click **Loose Parts to Vertex Colors**.
   - Optionally, enable "Create Vertex Groups from Loose Parts" to generate vertex groups.
3. To bake the vertex colors to a texture, click **Bake Vertex Colors to Image**.

### Lightmap UVs

1. Select your mesh(es).
2. In the **Game Tools** panel, enable **AutoUnwrap Lightmap UVs**.
3. Click **Create Lightmap UVs**.

### Naming and Export Tools

- Set prefixes, suffixes, and export paths as needed for Unreal Engine compatibility.

## Requirements

- Blender 3.0 or newer (tested on Blender 4.3)

---

## Known Issues

- **Performance:** The loose parts detection can be slow on very large or complex meshes.
- **Vertex Color Layer Overwrite:** If you run the loose parts tool multiple times, it will create multiple "LooseParts" vertex color layers.
- **Bake Node Setup:** The bake operator replaces certain nodes in the active material; custom node setups may be affected.
- **No Undo for Some Actions:** Some operations (like UV creation) may not be fully undoable in all Blender versions.
- **Limited Color Palette:** If you have more loose parts than colors in the palette, colors will repeat.

---

## Planned Features

- **Faster Loose Parts Detection:** Optimize the algorithm for large meshes.
- **Custom Color Palettes:** Allow users to define their own color sets.
- **Batch Export Tools:** Export multiple assets with one click.
- **Better Error Handling:** More robust checks and user feedback.
- **Support for More Bake Types:** Including AO, normals, etc.
- **Improved UI/UX:** More intuitive controls and documentation in the Blender UI.
