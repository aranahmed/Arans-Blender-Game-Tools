# Aran's Game Tools for Blender

**Aran's Game Tools** is a Blender add-on designed to streamline the asset pipeline between Blender and Unreal Engine, with a strong focus on **CSV-driven asset management** and seamless Unreal Python integration. This toolkit is ideal for game developers and technical artists who want to automate repetitive tasks, enforce naming/material conventions, and ensure their assets are always Unreal-ready.

## üöÄ Key Features

### CSV-Driven Asset Management

- **CSV-Based Validation:**  
  Import a CSV file containing your asset data (name, type, master material, etc). The add-on checks selected Blender objects against this data, ensuring consistency and correctness.

- **Custom Properties from CSV:**  
  Automatically assigns asset metadata (like `AssetName`, `AssetType`, `MasterMaterial`) as custom properties on your Blender objects, making your scene data-rich and ready for export.

- **Smart Renaming & Batch Correction:**  
  Instantly spot naming mismatches and batch-rename all assets to match your CSV conventions, including prefix/suffix rules.

- **Master Material Assignment:**  
  Assigns the correct master material from your CSV to each object, creating the material if it doesn't exist.

- **Error Reporting:**  
  Clear UI feedback for missing CSV data, incorrect names, or missing materials.

### Blender-to-Unreal Workflow

- **Loose Parts to Vertex Colors:**  
  Color each mesh island with a unique vertex color for easy ID map creation.

- **Bake Vertex Colors to Texture:**  
  Bake vertex colors to an image for export.

- **Vertex Groups from Loose Parts:**  
  Optionally create vertex groups for each loose part.

- **Lightmap UVs:**  
  One-click creation of a second UV channel for Unreal lightmaps.

- **Naming & Export Helpers:**  
  Set up prefixes, suffixes, and export paths for Unreal Engine assets.

### Unreal Python Integration

- **Automated Import:**  
  Use the provided Unreal Python scripts to batch-import assets, read the same CSV, and automatically assign master materials and correct naming inside Unreal.

- **Data Table Support:**  
  Import your CSV/JSON data directly into Unreal Engine DataTables for further automation and validation.

## üéÆ Use Cases in Game Development

- **Consistent Asset Naming:**  
  Enforce naming conventions across large teams and projects.

- **Automated Material Assignment:**  
  Guarantee every asset uses the correct master material, reducing manual errors.

- **Metadata-Driven Workflows:**  
  Store and transfer asset metadata from Blender to Unreal, enabling advanced pipelines (e.g., procedural spawning, gameplay tagging).

- **Batch Asset Validation:**  
  Quickly validate and correct hundreds of assets before export or import.
